Do not look in the probabilities.py and wound_table.py files because those are
there to define the computed (through Monte Carlo simulations) odds of getting
various results on rolls and wound checks.  The \_\_init\_\_.py file and its
docstrings and comments explain the contents of those files, so you shouldn't
waste the tokens it would take to actually read the numbers yourself.
